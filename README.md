# Computational Study of Thiophene via *Ab Initio* Electronic Structure Calculations

This repository contains a summary of my postgraduate dissertation project conducted at IIT BHU, focused on the computational modeling of thiophene dimers using quantum chemical methods.

##  Project Overview

Thiophene is a sulfur-containing aromatic compound with wide applications in organic electronics, optoelectronics, and medicinal chemistry. This project investigates the intermolecular interactions of thiophene dimers — particularly **π–π stacking** — using *ab initio* methods and **Density Functional Theory (DFT)**.

The study explores how different orientations (parallel, T-shape, stacked) and basis sets influence **interaction energies**, providing insight into the stability and nature of weak non-covalent interactions.

##  Methodology

- Software used: **Gaussian 16**
- Optimization of thiophene monomer geometry
- Calculation of interaction energies using the formula:  
  `E_int = E_dimer - 2 * E_monomer`
- Orientation types: Parallel, T-shape, Stacked
- Levels of theory:  
  - DFT Functionals: `B3LYP`, `wB97XD`, `PBEPBE`, etc.  
  - Ab initio method: `MP2`
- Basis sets: `6-31G`, `6-311+G(d,p)`, `cc-pVTZ`, `cc-pVQZ`, etc.

##  Results Summary

- Interaction energy depends strongly on the orientation and level of theory.
- The **parallel orientation** showed the most stable interaction energy among the configurations studied.
- The data supports potential applications of thiophene-based materials in electronics and bio-materials.
